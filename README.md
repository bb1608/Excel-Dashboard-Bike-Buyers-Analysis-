# Excel-Dashboard-Bike-Buyers-Analysis-

🚴 My First Excel Dashboard – Bike Buyers Analysis 🚴
Excited to share my first Excel-based dashboard, built using a dataset on bike buyers! 🎉
This dashboard uncovers key factors influencing bike purchases, analyzing trends in:
✅ Income Levels 📊 – Do higher earners buy more bikes?
✅ Age Groups 👶🧓 – Which age bracket shows the most interest?
✅ Commute Distance 🚗 – Does proximity impact the decision to buy?
✅ Education & Marital Status 🎓💍 – Any patterns here?
🛠 Data Cleaning & Preparation
Before building the dashboard, I performed multiple data cleaning steps to enhance readability and accuracy:
🔹 Removed Duplicates to ensure data integrity.
🔹 Standardized Values:
"M" & "S" in Marital Status were changed to "Married" & "Single."
"M" & "F" in Gender were changed to "Male" & "Female" to improve clarity.
🔹 Formatted Income Data by removing unnecessary decimal points.
🔹 Age Categorization: The dataset had numerous individual ages, making it difficult to visualize trends. Using an IF function, I grouped them into:
Adolescent
Middle
Old
🔹 Key Classification: The most critical column was "Purchased Bike" (Yes/No), which served as the classification point for analysis.
🔧 Tools Used:
✅ Microsoft Excel – Data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.
✅ Microsoft Drive – Sharing the dashboard.
This project was an incredible learning experience in data storytelling and visualization. Huge thanks to Alex Freberg for the inspiration! 🚀
